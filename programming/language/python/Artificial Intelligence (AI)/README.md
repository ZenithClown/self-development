# A Smarter Machine ü§ñ

<p align = "justify">The age of computer üñ•Ô∏è revolution triggered automation! We're obssesed with automating simple ‚úîÔ∏è lists to self-driving üèéÔ∏è! Automation involves desgining a smarter system, and with large computational powers, and the advent of AI we can now do so. I'm a dedicated AI/ML practitioner, and in this repository I've hosted a bunch of files that I have used for self-learning. Feel free to explore the contents, modify and/or contribute!</p>

## AI vs ML vs DL

<p align = "justify">In this new era of technology, companies and developers around the world are talking about embracing artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). All these acronyms are often loosely used in the field of technology. It is important to understand that all these acronyms are part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) umbrella.</p>

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

<p align = "justify">AI enables machines to think without any human intervention. It is a broad area of computer science. AI systems fall into three types: ANI: Artificial Narrow Intelligence, which is goal-oriented and programmed to perform a single task. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) which allows machines to learn, understand, and act in a way that is indistinguishable from humans in a given situation. ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) is a hypothetical AI where machines are capable of exhibiting intelligence that surpasses brightest humans.</p>

### Machine Learning (ML)

<p align = "justify">ML is a subset of AI that uses statistical learning algorithms to build smart systems. The ML systems can automatically learn and improve without explicitly being programmed. The recommendation systems on music and video streaming services are examples of ML. The machine learning algorithms are classified into three categories: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.</p>

### Deep Learning (DL)

<p align = "justify">This subset of AI is a technique that is inspired by the way a human brain filters information. It is associated with learning from examples. DL systems help a computer model to filter the input data through layers to predict and classify information. Deep Learning processes information in the same manner as the human brain. It is used in technologies such as driver-less cars. DL network architectures are classified into Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Recursive Neural Networks.</p>
