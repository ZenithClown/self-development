  📚 <b>Objective:</b> Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.
  
  You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Additional Note(s)

Binary Search is the fundamental/basic algorithm which searches the element in an sorted (either _ascending_ or _descending_) array. Details about the algorithm explanation can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoUiNv1SZA&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).
