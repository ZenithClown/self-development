<p align = "justify">ü§ì<b><a href = "https://projecteuler.net/about">Project Euler</a></b> is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems ‚ôæÔ∏è intended to be solved with computer üíª programs üìú. This repository üè∑Ô∏è, lists out the solutions for Project Euler, solved using <b><code>python3</code></b>.</p>

### Getting Started

<p align = "justify">The <code>directory</code> contains solutions to defined set of problems. Check the section below to see how to run the code. To create a PR append the name <b><code>[euler/XXXX]</code></b> where <code>XXXX</code> is the problem number - this helps to narrow down/search related problems easily. Check:</p>

* List of [Open Issue(s)](https://github.com/ZenithClown/self-development/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+euler) - Related to Project Euler
* Lis of [All Issue(s)](https://github.com/ZenithClown/self-development/issues?q=is%3Aissue+euler) - Related to Project Euler

### Running the Code
<p align = "justify">Using any Environment, where python3 is installed, this codes can be run - without requiring any sophisticated libraries (like NumPy, pandas, etc.). The general convention is as below:</p>

```python
from euler001 import * # where 001 = problem number
solver(1000) # prints out the answer
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏èDisclaimers

<p align = "justify">Popular "<i>technical assessment and remote interview solution</i>" ‚úèÔ∏è <a href = "https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hacker Rank</a> also provides a way to showcase coding skills üíº using <a href = "https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges">ProjectEuler+</a>. I've uploaded the exact solutuions as provided here. Project Euler advises on sharing solutions online for problems 1-100 (<a href = "https://projecteuler.net/about">about</a>), and thus the repository does not provide exact solution for problem 101+.</p>

### Progress Meter

<p align = "justify">The progress meter is available at <a href = "https://projecteuler.net/account">account</a> page. My attempt to solve Project Euler is mentioned below. Note: that the image is not updated regularly, so needs to be checked/updated using CI/CD pipeline/manually.</p>
