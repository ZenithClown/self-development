<p align = "justify">The repository features a collection of projects associated with <code>Q-Learning</code>. As defined in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning">WiKiPedia</a>, <q>Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state. <code>Q</code> refers to the function that the algorithm computes â€“ the expected rewards for an action taken in a given state.</q> A very good introduction is available at <a href = "https://www.novatec-gmbh.de/en/blog/introduction-to-q-learning/">novatech-gmbh.de/blog</a> which explains about the <code><q>agent</q></code> and <code><q>environment</q></code> which correlates with <code>state, rewards, and action</code>.</p>
