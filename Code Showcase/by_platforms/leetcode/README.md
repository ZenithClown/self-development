  A place to üñºÔ∏è showcase my activities and codes from [**`LeetCode`**](https://leetcode.com/MrHobo/), and store my üíª _code works_ for üë®‚Äçüéì learning and future references. The directory is divided into following sections - (i) üè≠ Study Plans, (ii) üîÅ extensions, and (iii) *language* specific solution files üìî.
  
  * üåü LeetCode posts new questions *weekly*, and I am trying to learn as many things as possible!
  * ‚úîÔ∏è Check my other coding practices and solutions [here](https://github.com/ZenithClown/self-development).
  * üßë‚Äç I generally uses the *free tier* of LeetCode, thus contents to *premium* problems are flagged.
  * üî£ The `python` folder denotes solutions in [`Py3`](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3108/).
  * ‚ÑπÔ∏è Sometimes I use the [LeetHub](https://github.com/marketplace/leet-hub) extensions to push my codes directly, however it is only supported in *chrome* and there is no option for selecting *subdirectory* as of now. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) also provides [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LeetCode.vscode-leetcode) which are saved in the `extension` directory by default, and are arranged. #TODO CI/CD Pipeline.
  
Problem constraints often gives an *hint* as to the type of methodology/techniques to be used. Here is a [*handy guide* on thinking techniques](https://sites.google.com/site/mostafasibrahim/programming-competitions/thinking-techniques) that discusses the use of possible techniques and algorithms for a particular set of constraints.
